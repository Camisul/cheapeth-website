How to deposit cheapETH L1 -> L2:

Send cTH to 0x974B6EC6DC5D0b51CA045E8cA94e4A3b22f0e096
With hexdata "d0e30db0" (enable in metamask settings)
Gas limit should auto adjust after you type the hexdata

Wait a bit, and you'll see the ocTH

On optimism, ocTH is an ERC20 called owETH at address 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006
Add it to metamask as a token to send your owETH and spread the owETH love!

Deploying contracts with remix:

cheapOptimism doesn't run the EVM, it runs the OVM, and hence needs a different solidity compiler.
Go to remix.ethereum.org

Add compiler (ethereum-optimism/solc-js/master-0.7): https://l2.cheapeth.org/data/soljson.js

Make sure your metamask is on cheapOptimism.

Enjoy!
